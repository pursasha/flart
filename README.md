#Flart: Coupon Management Application 

##For my CS 490 platform mobile development with Dart & Flutter class I am going to be creating a coupon management app. The app will be a tool for couponers to get access to important information, websites, and other features. I will be creating a home screen with severeal options for users to go into different features. The app will be a one shop for everything a couponer needs in preparation for their couponing trip. There will be pages that have important information for beginners and tools that all levels of couponers can use. As time permits, I hope to be able to use different APIs from some of the stores to allow users clip digital coupons from my app.

#Features:
- Organized links to store coupon policies.
- A collective table with important information about different stores that will be a quick guide for users.
- Additional important tools for consumers to use: database for stock up prices, list of weekly  inserts availble, etc.
- Ability to make shopping trip lists that will be broken down based on store and include a check list for coupons needed for certain deals.
- If time permits, my app will have several different websites/ applications linked for easy access to the different digital coupons that need to be clipped.

#Design
- My goal for the design of my app is for it to be simple but informative and easy to follow. Hopefully I will be able to use some of my digital designer background to help my app look very aestethic. The home page will either be consited of buttons to go to the different locations or it will be a sereies of inspirational and relatable quotes to couponing to keep the users entertained. In the menu bar there will be several options for the different features that I plan to have. Each page will have consisetent design colors and text to make sure the user is focusing on the content. Hopefully I can include pictures and graphics to make the appael of the app that much better.
